<!-- Project report (Readme file)
Each project should have a typical Readme file, together, with that additional information:

brief description of the original project plan, and what has and has not been achieved/changed in the final product
reflection of what went well and what went wrong with the project
reflection on the hard aspects of the project
what new has the group learned
total work hours dedicated to the project cumulatively by the group

The report should be as brief as possible, focusing on the most important aspects. -->
