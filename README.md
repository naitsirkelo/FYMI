# FYMI: Find Your Movie Info
### IMT2681 Project (Marius HÃ¥konsen & Ole K Larsen)

![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-deployed-green.svg)

### Overview
The plan for the FYMI bot was to create a service that would allow the user to access useful information about an IMDb title. The service should be available straight from a smartphone without using a browser, and should only require one line of text to get the information you need.
This feature is implemented using the Slack application with custom slash, "/", commands, usable from any phone, tablet or browser.

### Future updates
The application is currently only available on a private Slack channel, but will in the future be open for any Slack user to install to their channel.

### Assumptions
Every call to the created API will utilize the same user key provided by the OMDb API structure, which allows 1000 requests every 24 hours.

### Usage
###### /fymihelp
Writes all available commands to the Slack channel.
###### /fymiid    <IMDb movie id>    
Returns useful info from a movie with corresponding ID. 
(Example: tt0068646)
###### /fymititle <IMDb movie title>     
Gets the first resulting movie containing the title. 
(Example: "The Godfather")
###### /fymisearch <IMDb movie title>
Shows a drop-down list of movies containing the title, giving the user the option to choose between the 10 first movies found.
(Example: "Star Wars")
